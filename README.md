## Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get the app up & running.

```shell
commands here
```

Here you should say what actually happens when you execute the code above.

## Developing

### Built With
List main libraries, frameworks used including versions (React, Angular etc...)
- React
- SparkJava

### Prerequisites
What is needed to set up the dev environment. For instance, global dependencies or any other tools. include download links.
- Java 11 (https://adoptopenjdk.net/)
- NodeJS (version): https://nodejs.org/en/download/

### Setting up Dev

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/cs421sp21-homework/project-g13.git
cd cs421sp21-homework/project-g13/code/
packagemanager install
```

And state what happens step-by-step. If there is any virtual environment, local server or database feeder needed, explain here.

### Building

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here. for example:

- probably using Gradle? (./gradlew build build)
```shell
./configure
make
make install
```

Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above gets
executed.

### Deploying / Publishing
give instructions on how to build and release a new version
In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

- probably more Heroku stuff (./gradlew deployHeroku) (might be taken care of with continuous integration)
```shell
packagemanager deploy your-project -s server.com -u username -p password
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.

## Versioning

We can maybe use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning.

## Configuration

Here you should write what are all of the configurations a user can enter when using the project.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
Explain what these tests test and why.

```shell
Give an example
```

## Style guide

Explain your code style and show how to check it.

## Api Reference

If the api is external, link to api documentation. If not describe your api including authentication methods as well as explaining all the endpoints with their required parameters.
- Yelp API: https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/

## Database

Explaining what database (and version) has been used. Provide download links.
