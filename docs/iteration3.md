# Wireframe & Use-case

# Iteration Backlog

- As a user, I would like the program to learn my preference for the day based on my swipes and show me restaurants that match my preference so that I can find a restaurant earlier.
- As a group, we would like to be shown a leaderboard of votes from high to low and a recommended restaurant if no match was found so that we can discuss among our options.
- As a user, I would like my location and long term preferences (vegan, vegetarian, allergies etc.) to be remembered so that I donâ€™t have to set it repeatedly.
- As a user, I would like to set filters such as price and cuisine so that I can get tailored options.

# Tasks

- creating and working on the recommendation algorithm (this is beyond CRUD)
- recommending a restaurant if no match was found (frontend? I guess we can "call" the recommendation algorithm)
- showing the top choices of restaurants (involves socket.io, frontend)
- storing permanent user preferences in the backend (involves database and backend)
- allowing the user to store and access permanent preferences in the frontend (UI stuff/React)
- adding filters when searching for restaurants in the backend (involves backend and Yelp API)
- adding UI for filtering restaurants (frontend/UI)
