# Project Backlog

## Iteration 1 (minimal-operations)

- As a user, I would like to create a “swiping event” so that I can decide where I want to eat.
- As a user, I would like to see each restaurant’s information so that I can decide if I like it or not.
- As a user, I would like the restaurants shown to be close by so that I can actually get there.

## Iteration 2 (individual and groups)

- As a user, I would like to create an account and login so that my information can be saved.
- As a user, I would like to join a group so I can decide with my friends where to eat as a group.
- As a user, I would like to create a group so that I can decide where to eat with my friends.
- As a group, we would like to have a group ID so that joining groups are easier.
- As a user, I would like to mark a restaurant as appealing or not during a “swiping event” so that I can narrow down my options.
- As a group, we would like to be notified when we find a match so that we know we have found a place to eat at.
- As a group, we would like the “swiping event” to end after a certain amount of restaurants if no match was found so that it doesn’t go on forever.


## Iteration 3 (accounts)

- As a group, we would like to be shown a leaderboard of votes from high to low so that we can discuss among the options if no match was found.
- As a user, I would like the recommendations to learn my preferences for the day as I swipe so that I can find a match restaurant earlier.
- As a user, I would like my location and long term preferences (vegan etc.) to be remembered so I don’t have to set it repeatedly.
- As a user with an account, I would like for the order I am presented restaurant options during a "swiping event" to be based on my preferences so restaurants I am likely to prefer are presented first.
- As a user, I would like to set filters such as price and cuisine so that I can get tailored options.

## Iteration 4 (misc. features)

- As a user, I would like to be presented only with restaurants open at the time of swiping so that I can actually get food there if I like it.
- As a user, I would like to see who’s in the group so that I know all my friends have joined.
- As a user, I would like to see trending restaurants nearby so that I know what the community thinks are the best options right now.
- As a user, I would like my location to be automatically detected so that I don’t have to manually input it.

## Iteration 5 (more misc. features)

- As a user, I would like to join nearby groups so that joining groups are easier.
- As a user, I would like to continue swiping if a match is already found so that I can find more potential places I want to eat at.
