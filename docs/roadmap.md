# Project Backlog

## Iteration 1

- As a user, I want to be able to choose whether or not a restaurant is appealing so I can narrow down my
  choices to where I do want to eat.
- As a user, I want to be able to see a lot of information about each restaurant, including price, pictures, location, possibly some menu options
- As a user, I want the event to end after a certain amount of time or swipes so it doesn't go on forever.

## Iteration 2

- As a user, I want to be able to choose restaurants individually while still being a part of a group.
- As a user, I want to be able to create a group that other users can join so we can decide where to eat
  together.
- As a user, I want to be able to join a group on the app with friends so that we can decide decide where
  we want to eat together and the app can track all of our choices.
- As a user, I want to see the next closest restaurant to a match if no match has been reached by the end.

## Iteration 3

- As a user, I want to be notified when the group reaches a consensus and all matches on the same restaurant.
- As a user, I want to be able to set my preferences before each search so that the search is most effective.
- As a user, I want my choices to get more appealing based off of how I am swiping during that particular
  event.
- As a user, I want to be able to login and have a profile so they have the ability to join a group.

## Iteration 4
- As a user, I want to only see restaurants that are open at the time of swiping or at a specified time of
  eating so I am not swiping on closed restaurants for desired eating time.
- As a user, I want to be able to select random restaurants as an option if I'm not feeling any particular
  cuisine.
- As a user, I'd like to be able to search restaurants to look at prices and other menu options.
- As a user, I want to see how the restaurants ranked in case the first option no longer sounds appealing for the whole group.

## Iteration 5
- As a user, I want to be able to detect nearby rooms so I can quickly join in instead of having to send
  invite links around.
- As a user, I want the app to get my location automatically to provide the most accurate results.
- As a user, I would like to see my previous restaurants I've ended up eating at and the group it was with.
- As a user, I'd like to be able to create my own lists of restaurants (favorites), so then you can choose based off those.
