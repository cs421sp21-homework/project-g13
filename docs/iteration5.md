# OO Design

# Wireframe & Use-case

# Iteration Backlog
- As a user, I would like to continue swiping if a match is already found so that I can find more potential places I want to eat at.
- As a user, I would like to be presented only with restaurants open at the time of swiping so that the restaurant I've decided on is available right away.
- As a user, I would like to see whoâ€™s in the group so that I know all my friends have joined.
