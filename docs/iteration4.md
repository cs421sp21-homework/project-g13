**Use Case: Receiving assistance in choosing a restaurant**

# Iteration Backlog

- As a user, I would like to be presented only with restaurants open at the time of swiping so that the restaurant I've decided on is available right away.
- As a user, I would like to see who’s in the group so that I know all my friends have joined.
- As a user, I would like to see trending restaurants nearby so that I know what the community thinks are the best options right now.
- As a user, I would like the program to get my real-time location so that I don’t have to manually enter it.

# Tasks

- update filters frontend with an "open now" option
