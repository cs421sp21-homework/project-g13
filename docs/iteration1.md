**Use Case: Receiving assistance in choosing a restaurant**
1. The user opens the application.
2. The user will be presented with the "Start" page, view (1).
3. The user will click on the "Host a group" button.
4. The user will be presented with the "Group" page, view (2).
5. The user will click on the "Change Location" button and input his/her location.
6. The user will click on the "Begin" button.
7. The user will be presented with a "Restaurant option" page, view (3).
8. The user will click on "Yes" if he/she finds the option appealing, or on "No" if he/she finds it unappealing.
9. If the user clicks on "Yes", a new "Restaurant option" page will be presented.
10. If the user swipes right, the "Match found" page, view (4), will be presented.
11. The user will click on the "Done" button and be returned to the "Start" page.

# Iteration Backlog

- As a user, I would like to create a “swiping event” that will present me with a continuous stream of restaurant options so that I can decide where I want to eat.
- As a user, I would like to be able to input my location so that I will only be presented with restaurants that are near me.
- As a user, I would like to be presented with various details about each restaurant so that it will be easier to decide whether I wish to eat there or not.
- As a user, I would like to be able to mark each restaurant as "appealing" or "unappealing" so that I can narrow down my options.
