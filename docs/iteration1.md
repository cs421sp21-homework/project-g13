# Iteration Backlog
- As a user, I would like to create a “swiping event” that will present me with a continuous stream of restaurant options so that I can decide where I want to eat.
- As a user, I would like to be able to input my location so that I will only be presented with restaurants that are near me.
- As a user, I would like to be presented with various details about each restaurant so that it will be easier to decide whether I wish to eat there or not.
- As a user, I would like to be able to mark each restaurant as "appealing" or "unappealing" so that I can narrow down my options.
# Tasks
- Get a Yelp API key and get familiar with how the API works
- Create a Heroku project and add everyone in the group as a collaborator
