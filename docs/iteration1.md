# Iteration Backlog

- As a user, I would like to create a “swiping event” so that I can decide where I want to eat.
- As a user, I would like to mark a restaurant as appealing or not during a “swiping event” so that I can narrow down my options.
- As a user, I would like to see each restaurant’s information so that I can decide if I like it or not.
- As a user, I would like the restaurants shown to be close by so that I can actually get food there.
